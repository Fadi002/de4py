# de4py

**Advanced Python Deobfuscator & Reverse Engineering Toolkit**

De4py is an advanced Python deobfuscator with a beautiful UI (PySide6) and a robust set of features for malware analysts and reverse engineers. It supports both automatic deobfuscation of common packers and manual analysis tools.

Maintained by [Fadi002](https://github.com/Fadi002) and [AdvDebug](https://github.com/AdvDebug).

## 🚀 Features

| Feature | Function |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Deobfuscation** | Support for popular obfuscators: **Jawbreaker, BlankOBF, PlusOBF, Wodx, Hyperion, pyobfuscate**. |
| **File Analyzer** | Detection of packers (PyInstaller), hash calculation, suspicious string lookup, and metadata extraction. |
| **PyCode Execution** | Execute Python code inside the target process (useful for bypassing licensing checks). |
| **Pyshell GUI** | Custom GUI to easily inject and execute Python code in valid processes. |
| **Behavior Monitor** | Monitor process handles, memory access, sockets, and dumped content (including decrypted OpenSSL traffic). |

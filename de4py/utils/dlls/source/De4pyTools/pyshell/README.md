# PyInjector
PyInjector - Inject Python code into python process.

## How to use it ?
Simply write the code you want to inject into a file called code.py.   
The file as to be in the same folder of the software you want to inject it.   
You can also write it directly in the dll and recompile it.

## Why injecting python code into python script ?
This project is made for reverse-engineer and malware analyst, the main aspect of this project is to reverse-engineer any python script/executable easily.   
I put some usefull script in the src/ folder that can be used to reverse-engineer any script (even with pyarmor).

## Compatibilities
PyInjector is compatible with x32 and x64, python 3.7,3.8,3.9.

## Exemple
